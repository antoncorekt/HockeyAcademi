<p class="article-text team-text-p">We all know about hockey firsthand. We remember those times when we gathered all the yard, took sticks and chased a tennis ball on the football field. The current guys understand this is quite difficult, as the technology and the Internet have moved rapidly fast forward. They do not need to look for a pole, or to beg a brother's stick for the sake of playing. The word "hockey" came to us from the old French word "hoke", which means "curved shepherd staff." Hockey with a puck is a team sport on ice, based on the opposition of rivals on skates, who compete for winning the match. The winner is determined by the number of goals scored in the opponent's goal.

<p class="article-text team-text-p">
According to one of the versions, Canada is the birthplace of the game with a puck. 
In confirmation of this, in some paintings of the sixteenth century, depicts the masses 
of people playing on a frozen river in something resembling hockey. The first venue for the match was Montreal. 
The squad consisted of nine people who played with a wooden washer, and protective gear was taken from an equally 
famous game - baseball. The first rules of the game of hockey were invented by students of McGill University in 1877. 
And two years later the Canadian Robertson gave the idea of using a rubber disc, instead of a wooden washer, which was 
immediately manufactured. The game was presented in 1883, at the Montreal Winter Carnival, due to the increase in its 
popularity. And in 1886 the hockey rules were completely modernized and printed. </p>
