Mankind has long since emerged from a young age and no longer trusts all kinds of shamans, fortune tellers and sorcerers. However, in our days there are many people who believe in all kinds of signs and superstitions. Students, chauffeurs, doctors, and other professional groups have their own list of superstitions that are unique to them. A separate line can be noted hockey players. Like no other, they have a lot of them, and inherent only to them.

When did these superstitions appear? Most likely, with the very <b> education of hockey </b>, the day when the Canadians first came out on the ice (after all it is attributed to the invention of this sport). Therefore, the NHL can be called a museum of various amusing rituals and signs. The reason for their appearance are provincial, not always educated hockey players, from small Canadian towns and cities, the ancestors of one of the most powerful leagues in the world. They were the first, because of their lack of education, began to use rituals from their daily life on ice fields. For example, if you take the beginning of the last century, the famous striker Ban Cook from the team "Boston Bruins", had a habit of sewing a dried rabbit's foot in sports pants. But goalkeeper Clint Benedict from the team "Ottawa Senators" on the net of the gate hung a horseshoe.

In the national sports school of hockey, there are also superstitions. About happy and not happy numbers it is already possible to add legends. So in the previously mentioned league NHL number 13 is considered unlucky, to which our players come to play in foreign clubs do not pay attention. Conducting with the students <b> individual hockey classes </b>, the trainer forcibly convey their views and quirks to the growing sportsmen.

<li> During the playoff matches, many hockey players prefer not to shave. In the 1979-1980 game season, the New York Islanders' athletes considered their beardedness a good sign. And here is the result - the Stanley Cup they took four times in a row. </li>
 <li> Canadian goalkeeper Patrick Roy during the game avoided advancing on the line of marking. </li>
<li> Another popular superstition is that a puck thrown to the stands must necessarily be returned to the field when your team is ahead of the opponent in the count, because this was a lucky puck. And if he loses or is at the moment a draw, then they take it back. </li>
<li> Until the first goal of the team is not accepted to drink water. But after the goal, you must do it. The fans also follow this sign. </li>
<li> Another hockey goalie Pellet Lindberg never parted with his happy yellow t-shirt, directly wearing out his ammunition. </li>
<li> Alexei Yashin puts all his hockey outfits on a lucky black turtleneck. The team-mates confirm this fact. </li>
<li> Get the shoelaces from the skates, and before the game lace them again - a ritual conducted by Canadian defender Ray Burke. </li>
<li> Ilya Bryzgalov, hockey player, does not touch the gates of his team before the game, believing that by doing this he will frighten off luck. </li>
<li> Again the superstition associated with clothing: Scottish hockey coach Scottie Bowman refuses to change his tie, in the winning series of games the team he coaches. </li>
</ul>

You can continue this list for a long time, but one thing is clear. Superstition is almost like a tradition. Only there are common traditions, but there are inherent, directly, to one particular person. And to believe in them, or not to believe - is everyone's business. Although, if these signs help win your favorite team, then why should they not follow?
