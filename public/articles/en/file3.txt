Certainly, hockey is considered one of the most severe sports. Having looked at the life of many athletes, 
it immediately becomes clear that these people are not weak neither in body nor in soul. 
How much effort it takes to remain with the most demanded players in such a big competition. 
Thanks to their parents, for having given them to the sport in time and not missed <b>the set for the hockey school</b>, 
the guys became the best of the best sportsmen in the world.

One of the most popular at the moment is the young Canadian player Sidney Crosby. 
He is the central striker of the Pittsburgh Penguins team, this is one of the clubs 
that plays in the NHL. Sidney is a true professional. He brilliantly played along with the "penguins" 
and got the Stanley Cup. The guy is always ready to give interviewers an interview, 
which is very encouraging to his fans. One of the athlete's talents is the ability to play 
with other players. For this skill and its simplicity, it is very appreciated by coaches. 
Despite the fact that he is a two-time Olympic champion and the winner of the World Youth Championship, 
he was not allowed to relax somehow in relation to sports and give himself liberties. Crosby was not seen passive, 
both in training and in games. He loves sports with all his heart, which once again proves 
the professionalism of this guy.

It would be a sin not to mention Jaromir the Great. A professional born in the Czech Republic, 
at the moment he is the owner of the club "Rytiři Kladno". His whole career was talked about 
with admiration and even with hatred. To take a great interest in sports Yaromir has begun already 
since four years, after for the first time took a stick in hands. The decisive role was played precisely 
by this event in the life of the then-toddler Jagr. To instill love for sports he was given a good <b>hockey kit</b>. 
After this moment and up to the present day, Jaromir does not represent his life, if it somehow will 
not be connected with this game. After some time, the athlete said that he decided to completely leave for Kladno. 
Becoming a world champion in 2005 and 2010, once again confirmed his skills. He rightfully belongs to one hundred 
of the best players in the NHL.

The third, about whom it is worthwhile to tell, will be Evgeni Malkin. This is a person whose 
element is ice. From his earliest childhood, he went on the field, along with his father, 
a hockey player, who was his first coach. It can not be said that the future star was seen 
in him from his youth. If not for his stubborn desire to train and reach athletic heights, 
he would not have won the Stanley Cup in the 2006/2007 season, nor was he one of the highest paid 
players in the world in hockey. He proved by his own example that it is only through hard work that 
he can achieve heights.

Thousands of athletes said that hockey is an integral part of their lives. But to become a worthy 
player, one love is not enough. In addition to the desire and desire to go quality training. 
You can also attend <b>ice hockey training sessions</b> and test your will on perseverance. 
Only after becoming several times on the ice, is already awakening a passion for the game. 
Because if a person has an interest in this sport, then it is unlikely he will ever be lost. 
Hockey is a sea of emotions, adrenaline, a harmonious combination of strength and spirit. 
Not everyone has the courage to finish training, but if you still think about what would happen 
if the most popular players regretted themselves in the classroom, the answer pops up. 
I would not be watching the world now for the brilliant games of Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid, 
Patrick Kane, Nikita Kucherov and many others!
